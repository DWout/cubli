% Run controller in workspace, designed with file cubli_control_merged.m,
% on a system that is slightly different then the one simulated. Note, the
% workspace must be complete, and not changed, after controller design.

% Check workspace for all parameters

% Make parameters slightly different

% Define real system parameters like sample time

% Create workspace variable that is used in sim_cubli_simu as motor torque pertubation

% Run sim, and write output

% Run system identification
